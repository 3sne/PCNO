# Parallel Computation of Numerical Operations (using CUDA)
This repo he originally meant for PCAP course project and hence its comes with an implementation of t-sne algorithm [https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf]. T-sne is visualization algorithm for high dimensional data. We tested the algorithm on mnist dataset [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/]. We successfully visualized 728 dimension data in 2 dimensions. Here are the results:
